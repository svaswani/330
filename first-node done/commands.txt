=====Node========
The node command actually starts up the node server invoking the file specified as the main program.

Command: 
node  filepath/filenameOfMainProgram

Example: 
node  ./src/main.js
=================

======NPM========
NPM is the Node Package Manager. NPM is used to install, configure and run packages. 
Your code is also a package that will be handled by the package manager.

Commands:
npm init 
--------
The npm init command creates (initializes) a new node project. 
The init command asks basic questions about the project 
such as the name, description, main program file (entry point), 
git repo, author, license, etc. 
This commands creates a package.json for the application. 
Inside of the package.json file created by npm init, there is a section for scripts.
This section holds scripts used by node under certain commands. 

Example:
name: (first node) first-node
version: (0.0.0)
description: Our first node project
entry point: (index.js) main.js
test command: 
git repository:
keywords: NPM Node Intro
author: Cody Van De Mark
license: (ISC) Proprietary 


npm start
--------
The npm start command fires the start script inside of the package.json file.
By default this command does not do anything. You have to add a start script to the package.json file.

For example inside of the package.json, your start script might look like this.
"scripts": {
  "start": "node ./src/index.js",
  "test": "echo \"Tests complete\"
}
  
In this case, the start script above would fire when the npm start command is run.
