//Node implements commonJS for imports and exports.
//Node is setup that every class has its own "module" object that controls the exports and other module information
//The exports object inside of the module contains everything public from this class
//The name of the variable in the module.exports does not need to match the name of the variable in this class
//For example you could do "module.exports.retrieveMessage = getMessage;" and it would be called retrieveMessage 
//anywhere it was imported.
//In this case the getMessage function will be public for anyone who imports this module
module.exports.getMessage = getMessage;
